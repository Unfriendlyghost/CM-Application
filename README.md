# CM-Application
This holds my work towards the Critical Mass application tasks I have been asked to complete.

Work/Project Examples
- Provide up to three examples of work/projects that you've recently participated in and provide detailed information about your role and contributions to the project.

Tower of Two Dimensions.
I'm currently studying Computer GAmes  Programming at university so for the courses Team Project module I was assigned a with four other students to create a game in 12 weeks and present it infront of the class at the end of the term. The objectives of this module were to teach and have us experiance working in a team on a long term project. In our team three of us were assigned roles to add onto the work we were already doing. I allected to be our groups project manager which tasked me with planning weekly meetings and checking up on my teammates to make sure they were following through on the work they were assigned. I also presented our finished game to our class at the end of term. The presentations were a chance for us to explain our game and workflow to our lectures and a oppertunity for the lectures to cretice our presentation so that we might have a better idea of how we present our work to a publishing company.

Inspiration
- Provide up to three examples of work that has recently inspired you from a technical perspective. These can be open source projects, CodePens/CodeSandboxes, blog posts, etc. Be sure to include specifics on what you found inspiring.

As an aspiring video game programmer I enjoy looking at different games, at what they do well and what was exicuted poorly to better inform my own decisions when designing and developing games.
Although it came out just over two years ago to date I find the video game TitanFall 2 as a increadible example of game design. A quick sinopsis of the gameplay: you can run, jump, and climb around as a pilot shooting other players, you can then transition to piloting a large robot (titan) that hold large, powerful weapons. Heres a link to the multiplayer trailer of the game for visual representation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ISYN1AshZY. For any game to do well it needs to feel fun to play, Titanfall 2 manages to make playing as a pilot or titan equally fun yet vastly differnt in play style, and transitioning from one to the other flows well. It's this part of the game that I find so inspirational.



Focus
- If you were given the time and resources to build/learn anything you wanted during your internship, where would you choose to focus your efforts? Provide a brief description of how you would spend your time.

During my intership I'd like to focus on two areas.
First being application development (both web and moblie). I've been interested in creating applications since joining university, unfortiantly the module we did on the subject was underwheling in my oppinion so I'd love to have the chance to learn the steps and standards from a profesional company.
Thinking a bit broader, I think it's important to learn/experiance how a company works when working on a project. It has been drilled into my head by my lecturers at university that when hiring, companies are looking for both technical knowledge and industry experiance. Basicaly proof that you have at least a basic understanding of how a company works.

As for how I would spend my time I'd hope I could kill to birds with one stone so to speak. In an ideal scenario during the indership I'd work with employees and others on an application project, learning what I can from my betters. During all this I'd be able to observe and experiance how a project and company "interact", seeing what departments get involved, how different departments interact with each other, etc.

If posible I'd also like to focus some time on website design and development.
