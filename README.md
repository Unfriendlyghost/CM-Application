Tower of Two Dimensions.

I'm currently studying Computer Games Programming at university so for the courses Team Project module I was assigned a with four other students to create a game in 12 weeks and present it in front of the class at the end of the term. The objectives of this module were to teach and have us experience working in a team on a long-term project. In our team three of us were assigned roles to add onto the work we were already doing. I allected to be our groups project manager which tasked me with planning weekly meetings and checking up on my teammates to make sure they were following through on the work they were assigned. 
Our team spent the first couple of weeks planning what our game would be, look like, how it would fit the given theme "replay ability", and so on. We decided of a top down dungeon crawler that had randomly generated dungeons from a library of pre-made rooms. The bulk of my work went towards a Room Creation Tool, which allowed players to create their own rooms which would then be added to the overall library of rooms. I programmed the RCT and procured (and in some cases redrew) the tile assets, as well as the scripts that saved and loaded the tile maps so that the main section of the game could generate them. I also presented our finished game to our class at the end of term. The presentations were a chance for us to explain our game and workflow to our lectures and a opportunity for the lectures to critique our presentation so that we might have a better idea of how we present our work to a publishing company.

One Week Wonder

Directly following the 12 weeks of developing our first game, our last project for Team Project was what the lecturers called a week in industry where we took what we had learned from the 12-week project and create a game in 5 days. During these 5 days we had to come in at nine in the morning and could only leave after five in the afternoon. The idea was to simulate a games development companies work week, we even had the fortune of having a representative of Sumo Digital come in the first day to give us a presentation and our themes, he also returned to the last day to review the finished games. Given the themes "racing" and "unique movement" our team brainstormed and to make our game stand out from the rest we decided to combine the two themes to make a racing game which incorporated unique movement. For this project I worked on many different elements in the game: I programmed the grenades and the controls that allowed the player to throw them, I built the second half of our games final level based of my teammates design, I created the moving platforms that added variety to the level. I again presented our work to my class with my teammates doing a live demo after (as every team did). Here is a link to my portfolio that has a screen capture video of our team playing the game: https://maxhughes557.wixsite.com/website/monochrome-mess-around-copy.


Calendar Managment Application

With my previous project examples, I wanted to focus on the skills I've learnt while working in a team and the accomplishments I've achieved working on both a long-term and short-term project with others. This last example of my work I'd like to show you is based on my ability to self-teach. For background on my course we had an Application Development module which unfortunately was not taught well. Our final assignment for the module was to develop a calendar management application that could be used by multiple users. We had to create a REST API that all interactions went through, two different clients with one that was web based and another that could be either a mobile app or a windows application, and use a relational database that stored all the information retaining to the calendar. Now a problem with this assignment was that very little of the material we had been taught or given during classes was relevant to this assignment, because of this a lot of us in the class were forced to look for alternative routes. In my case I watched a tutorial series I found online which taught me how to run a MySQL server and Json database using XAMPP and create clients that interacted with it, I then took that and adapted it to fit my assignments criteria. While the module was not what I had hoped, the satisfaction from being able to complete the assignment with what felt like a large roadblock was a big achievement. I've included some of the code from my windows client application, these are Form1 which is the code for the front end of the calendar and the RestClient which is the code for the REST API for this client.



Inspiration
- Provide up to three examples of work that has recently inspired you from a technical perspective. These can be open source projects, CodePens/CodeSandboxes, blog posts, etc. Be sure to include specifics on what you found inspiring.

Titanfall 2

As an aspiring video game programmer, I enjoy looking at different games, at what they do well and what was executed poorly to better inform my own decisions when designing and developing games.
Although it came out just over two years ago to date, I find the video game Titanfall 2 as a great example of game design. A quick synopsis of the gameplay: you can run, jump, and climb around as a pilot shooting other players, you can then transition to piloting a large robot (titan) that hold large, powerful weapons. Hereâ€™s a link to the multiplayer trailer of the game for visual representation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ISYN1AshZY. For any game to do well it needs to feel fun to play, Titanfall 2 manages to make playing as a pilot or titan equally fun yet vastly different in play style and transitioning from one to the other flows well. It's this part of the game that I find so inspirational. The maps are designed to have areas where titans excell and areas where only a pilot can access with these areas often crossing over each other makeing playing as either viable. This also means that each effects how the other plays, a pilot dosen't want to run into an area that is heavy with titan acctivity for fear of being targeted so they might have to change what route they take. I don't know how much this counts towards the technical perspective you have asked for but examening how such design decision affect a game really interests me and is the first thing that can to mind when it can to things that inspire me.



Focus
- If you were given the time and resources to build/learn anything you wanted during your internship, where would you choose to focus your efforts? Provide a brief description of how you would spend your time.

During my internship I'd like to focus on two areas.
First being application development, especially mobile. I've been interested in creating applications since joining university, unfortunately the module we did on the subject was underwhelming in my opinion, so I'd love to have the chance to learn the steps and standards from a professional company. I know looking at some of Critical Mass's previous works that you have done some really impressive jobs with mobile applications, the United Nations exhibition and the Nissan Die hard fan projects jump to my mind first.
Tt to learn/experiehinking a bit broader, I think it's importannce how a company works when working on a project. It has been drilled into my head by my lecturers at university that when hiring, companies are looking for both technical knowledge and industry experience. Basically, proof that you have at least have a basic understanding of how a company works.

As for how I would spend my time I'd hope I could kill two birds with one stone so to speak. In an ideal scenario during the internship I'd work with employees and others on an application project, learning what I can from my betters. During all this I'd be able to observe and experience how a project and company "interact", seeing what departments get involved, how different departments interact with each other, etc.

If possible, I'd also like to focus some time on website design and development.



Coding Challenge

I like to start this section by explaining that the majority of my programming experiance has been focused around games and 3D graphics. While I do have experiance with javascript (it was actually the first language I started with) I'm much more used to the C languages. I've never been asked to fork a peice of code before so this was an interesting challenge.

Being unfamiliar with CodeSandbox I am not sure if the solution was supposed to be linked with the project. I bring this up as I tried originally to complete the challenge without looking at the solution, but I ended up looking at the solution for clues. Because of this I fear that my code is structured very similarly to the solution. I wondered perhaps if there was something more that was required of the question so I researched and picked the solution appart and I now understand better how it works but I don't want to pretend that the solution didn't influence my final build, as the solution provided seemed to be the most efficient way to structure the program. To show some of my thinking I have left in some of my ealier code (commented out of course) as an example of where I started with the challenges. I am slightly worried that I may have misunderstood the objective of the challenege.
